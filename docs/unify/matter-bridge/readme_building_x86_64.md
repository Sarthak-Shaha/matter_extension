# Building the Unify Matter Bridge for Debian Bullseye (Or similar Ubuntu) x86_64 

> **Note:**
> In the following subsections the commands should either be run on your local development machine or inside a running Docker container, as distinguished by the structure of the example.
>
> - _some-command_ should be executed on your local machine.
>   - _`dev-machine:~$ some-command`_
> - _some-other-command_ should be executed inside the Docker container.
>   - _`root@docker:/<dir>$ some-other-command`_

## Set Up the Matter Build Environment

Once you have all the necessary submodules, source the Matter environment with the following command. This loads a number of build tools and makes sure the correct toolchains and compilers are used for compiling the Unify Matter Bridge.

## Check Out Submodules

Check out the necessary submodules with the following command.
> ðŸ”´ Assuming you have cloned the matter repo in `~/matter`

```bash
dev-machine:~/matter$ ./scripts/checkout_submodules.py --platform linux
```

## Clone and Stage the Unify SDK Repository 

> ðŸ”´ Assuming you have cloned the matter repo in `~/matter` 

```bash
dev-machine:~/matter$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/SiliconLabs/UnifySDK.git --recursive ../uic-matter
```

## Build the Docker Container (host compilation)

```bash
dev-machine:~/matter$ docker build -t unify-matter-host --build-arg ARCH=amd64 silabs_examples/unify-matter-common/docker/
```
## Run the docker container (host compilation)

> ðŸ”´
> Make sure the directory structure is like follows where Unify repo `uic-matter/` and matter repo `matter/` are at same directory level.
> 
> ```shell
> .
> â”œâ”€â”€ matter
> â””â”€â”€ uic-matter
> ```

Start the docker from `matter/` directory where you cloned the matter repo: Here we assume `matter/` is in `~`

```bash
dev-machine:~$ cd matter/
dev-machine:~/matter$ docker run -it -v $PWD:/matter -v $PWD/../uic-matter:/uic unify-matter-host
```

## Build libunify for host

The Unify Matter Bridge depends on the libunify library from the Unify project.

This library must first be compiled for the host, by changing directory to the `/uic` directory and running the following:

```bash
root@docker:/uic$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/stage -GNinja -B build_unify_amd64/ -S components
root@docker:/uic$ cmake --build build_unify_amd64
root@docker:/uic$ cmake --install build_unify_amd64 --prefix $PWD/stage
```

After compiling the Unify library, set the below path in the PKG_CONFIG_PATH.
The path is for the staged Unify library.

```bash
root@docker:/uic$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:$PWD/stage/share/pkgconfig
```

If you want to be able to use Zap to generate code from Unify XML files you need to export UCL_XML_PATH as well.

```bash
root@docker:/uic$ export UCL_XML_PATH=$PWD/stage/share/uic/ucl
```

## Activate Matter development environment

Once you have all the necessary submodules, source the Matter environment with the following command. This loads a number of build tools and makes sure the correct toolchains and compilers are used for compiling the Unify Matter Bridge.

Make sure you are in `matter/` directory

```bash
root@docker:/matter$ git config --global --add safe.directory /matter
root@docker:/matter$ git config --global --add safe.directory /matter/third_party/pigweed/repo
root@docker:/matter$ source ./scripts/activate.sh
```

## Compile the Unify Matter Bridge 


```bash
root@docker:/matter$ cd silabs_examples/unify-matter-bridge/linux/
root@docker:/matter/silabs_examples/unify-matter-bridge/linux$ gn gen out/host
root@docker:/matter/silabs_examples/unify-matter-bridge/linux$ ninja -C out/host unify-matter-bridge
```

> ðŸ”´ After building, the `unify-matter-bridge` binary is located at `/matter/silabs_examples/unify-matter-bridge/linux/out/host/obj/bin/unify-matter-bridge`.

## Compile the chip-tool

The `chip-tool` is a CLI tool that can be used to commission the bridge and to control end devices.

```bash
root@docker:/matter$ cd examples/chip-tool

root@docker:/matter/examples/chip-tool$ gn gen out/amd64

root@docker:/matter/examples/chip-tool$ ninja -C out/amd64
```

> ðŸ”´ After building, the chip-tool binary is located at `/matter/examples/chip-tool/out/amd64/chip-tool`.

## Unit Testing

Unit testing is always a good idea for quality software. Documentation on writing unit tests for the Matter Unify Bridge is in the
[README.md](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/matter/blob/latest/silabs_examples/unify-matter-bridge/linux/src/tests/README.md).
