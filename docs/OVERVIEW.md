# Silicon Labs Matter User's Guide Overview

Welcome to the Silicon Labs Matter user documentation set. This provides all of the information required to use the Matter demos or start development with Matter on the Thread and Wi-Fi transport protocols. 

> **Note:** The Thread development use cases differs from Wi-Fi because the Thread protocol requires the use of an Open Thread Border Router (OTBR).

> **Note:** The Matter Bridge development use cases differs from Wi-Fi because it requires the use of the [Unify Host SDK](https://www.silabs.com/developers/unify-sdk).
