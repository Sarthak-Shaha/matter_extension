# Getting Started with SoC Mode

This guide describes how to get started developing an application for the SiWx91x in System-on-chip (SoC) mode, where both the application and the networking stack run on the SiWx917 chipset.

## Check Prerequisites

In order to run Matter over Wi-Fi, check for the following prerequisites:

### Hardware Requirements

The following hardware devices are required for executing Matter over Wi-Fi:

### Troubleshoot SiWx917 SOC Firmware Update Failure
If the firmware update fails, try the following:
  - Toggle the power switch towards AEM (Advanced Energy Monitoring) on the WSTK board.
  - Perform the following steps and try the firmware update again
     - Toggle the ISP switch towards ISP on the radio board.
     - Press the RESET button on the WSTK board.
     - Toggle the ISP switch away from ISP on the radio board.
     - In the Flash section in step 5 above, click Erase chip.
     - The flash will be erased.
     - Retry the firmware upgrade.


## Building Matter Application on SOC device
- To build Matter Application on SOC device, refer [Building Procedure](./SW_SETUP.md)

## Flashing Images/Binaries on the SiWx917 SoC platform using Ozone and Simplicity Commander

1. SiWx917 SoC device support is available in the latest Simplicity Commander(version 1v15p3). To flash the TA Firmware/Matter application on SiWx917 SoC,
    - Convert the .s37 file into .rps file using the below command,
         
      ```shell
      commander rps create <output file with .rps extension> --app <input file with .s37 extension>
      ```

    - Flash to the device using,          
    
      ```shell
      commander rps load <file-name>.rps
      ```

2. Official support for SiWx917 SoC for Common Flash Board is not yet available in the Ozone Debugger, but can be configured - [Ozone Environment Setup for SiWx917 SoC](SiWx917_Enablement_For_Ozone.md).

3. After creating the rps file flash the binary to the board by using Simplicity Commander, refer [Flashing SiWx917 SOC Using Simplicity Commander](../general/FLASHING_USING_COMMANDER.md#flashing-the-siwx917-soc-matter-pre-built-binary-using-simplicity-commander)

4. Flashing the Matter application using Ozone Debugger

   - Download the Pre-built images for SiWx917 SoC Matter Application (.out file) from [Matter Artifacts page](../general/ARTIFACTS.md)
   - Refer [Flashing MATTER Application Using Ozone debugger](./SiWx917_Enablement_For_Ozone.md)
   - Go to *Demo Execution - Commissioning a SiWx917 SoC Device using chip-tool for Linux* section, to run the demo with SiWx917 SoC

**Note:**
1. SiWx917 SoC Common flash boards are not supported by Ozone.
2. To enable RTT logs, download **JlinkDevices.xml** file from the [Matter Artifacts page](../general/ARTIFACTS.md) and install in the Jlink installation path.
 
## Enabling JLink RTT Logs for SOC Boards
1. To Configure the JLink RTT Viewer for SOC board, refer [Configure JLink RTT](./SiWx917_Enablement_For_Ozone.md#steps-to-configure-the-siwx917-soc-on-the-jlink-rtt-logging-and-ozone-debugger)

2. Open JLink RTT Viewer and click on three dots beside **Specify Target Device**

   ![Silicon Labs - design](./images/jlink-rtt-soc-selection.png)

3. select Manufacturer as **Silicon Labs** and device section search `Si917CommonFlash` or `Si917DualFlash` as per board connected to machine then click "ok" 

   ![Silicon Labs - design](./images/jlink-rtt-soc-board-selection.png)

4. Select Target Interface as `JTAG` & Speed as `8000KHz`(Default) then click "ok"

5. Now the JLink-RTT is connected and will print the device logs

## Demo Execution - Commissioning a SiWx917 SoC Device using chip-tool for Linux

> **Note**: Commissioning can be done using chip-tool running either on Linux or Raspberry Pi.

1. Get the SSID and PSK of the Wi-Fi network (WPA2 - Security) you are connected to.

2. Run the following:

    ```shell
    $ cd $MATTER_WORKDIR/matter
    ```

    ### Commissioning Command:

    ```shell
    $ out/standalone/chip-tool pairing ble-wifi 1122 $SSID $PSK 20202021 3840
    ```

> **Note:**
>    1. The Node ID used here is `1122`. This will be used in future commands.
>    2. The below given steps (3, 4, 5) are for Lighting-app, use app specific commands if you are using any other application.

3. To turn **on** the LED on the SiWx917:
    ```shell
    $ out/standalone/chip-tool onoff on 1122 1
    ```

4. To turn **off** the LED on the SiWx917:
    ```shell
    $ out/standalone/chip-tool onoff off 1122 1
    ```

5. The updated **on/off** state may be verified with the following command:
    ```shell
    $ out/standalone/chip-tool onoff read on-off 1122 1
    ```

If you are having difficulty getting the chip-tool to commission the device
successfully, refer to the troubleshooting information on the 
[Running the Matter Demos over Wi-Fi on EFR32 hosts page](./RUN_DEMO.md).

As the device remembers the Access Point credentials given for commissioning, if
you want to run the demo multiple times, do a [Factory Reset](./SiWx917_Enablement_For_Ozone.md#siwx917-soc-factory-reset).

The commissioning command mentioned above does the following:

- chip-tool scans BLE and locates the Silicon Labs device that uses the specified discriminator
- Sends the Wi-Fi SSID and Passkey
- The Silicon Labs device will join the Wi-Fi network and get an IP address.
It then starts providing mDNS records on IPv4 and IPv6
- chip-tool then locates the device over Wi-Fi and establishes operational certificates
- Future communications (tests) will then happen over Wi-Fi
