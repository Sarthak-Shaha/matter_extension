# Frequently Asked Questions and Troubleshooting for Matter over Wi-Fi

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Bluetooth connection fails when trying to commission the system through the chip-tool:

**Command leading to error:**

`$ out/standalone/chip-tool pairing ble-wifi 1122 mySSID myPassword 20202021 3840`

Where `mySSID` is **your AP's SSID** and `mypassword` is **your AP's password**.

**Error example:**

```shell
[1659464425.856025][34818:34823] CHIP:DL: HandlePlatformSpecificBLEEvent 16386
[1659464425.856035][34818:34823] CHIP:IN: Clearing BLE pending packets.
[1659464425.856055][34818:34823] CHIP:IN: BleConnection Error: ../../examples/chip-tool/third_party/connectedhomeip/src/platform/Linux/bluez/Helper.cpp:1775: CHIP Error 0x000000AC: Internal error
```

> This error indicates that the Bluetooth connection between your system and
> laptop is failing. Follow the given procedure and then retry the chip-tool
> commissioning command.

**Procedure:**

1. Stop Bluetooth service:

    ```shell
    $ systemctl stop bluetooth.service
    ```

2. Wait 20 seconds
3. Restart Bluetooth service:

    ```shell
    $ sudo service bluetooth restart
    ```

4. Unblock Bluetooth service:

    ```shell
    $ rfkill unblock all
    ```

5. Enable Bluetooth service:

    ```shell
    $ sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
    ```

6. Issue the pairing command:

    ```shell
    $ out/standalone/chip-tool pairing ble-wifi 1122 mySSID mypassword 20202021 3840
    ```

    > Where `mySSID` is **your AP's SSID** and `mypassword` is **your AP's
    > password**.

### 2. Unsupported certificate format Error:

> When trying to commission the system, if an `Unsupported certificate format`
> error (example below) is encountered, follow the procedure stated below.

**Error example:**

```shell
[1659631352.672826][5076:5076] CHIP:TOO: Run command failure: ../../examples/chip-tool/third_party/connectedhomeip/src/controller/CHIPDeviceController.cpp:1275: CHIP Error 0x00000050: Unsupported certificate format
```

**Procedure:**

-   Delete the existing certificates on your laptop with the following command
    run from the `/connectedhomeip` directory:

    ```shell
    $ /bin/rm /tmp/chip_*
    ```

-   Issue the commissioning command

### 3. WLAN connection fails from RS9116 during commissioning when channel 13 is selected on the AP:

The required channel becomes available for connection when the WLAN connection region is configured during compilation to one that supports the channel, such as for Japan for channel 13. 

In order to use the desired channel, before building, make sure the WLAN connection region is configured correctly by reviewing/modifying the following lines in 
**/examples/platform/silabs/efr32/rs911x/rsi_wlan_config.h**:
```c
//Make sure this is set to RSI_ENABLE
#define RSI_SET_REGION_SUPPORT RSI_ENABLE

// Note that the channels available for WLAN connection depend on the region selected
// Make sure this is set to 1 to configure from RSI_REGION_CODE value below
// 0: region configurations taken from beacon
// 1: region configurations taken from user
#define RSI_SET_REGION_FROM_USER_OR_BEACON 1

// 0 : Default Region domain
// 1 : US
// 2 : EUROPE
// 3 : JAPAN
#define RSI_REGION_CODE 3
```

### 4 . Incorrect firmware version

```shell
cd ./third_party/silabs/wiseconnect-wifi-bt-sdk/firmware
```

You will get appropriate firmware in the above mentioned path.

Note:

1.  How to check the current using firmware version?

    > You can find the currently using firmware version in the DUT log.

2.  How to check whether you are using correct firmware version or not?

    > Compare last 5 digits of firmware version mention in the above path with
    > the currently using firmware version.

### 5 . Apple Homepod associated failures

If there is an Apple Homepod on the network paired with a Thread device, and a commissioning failure is seen with error `3000001`:

> Either remove the Apple Homepod from the network, or unpair it from all Thread devices, before re-trying the commissioning.

### 6 . Commissioning failure at step 18

1. Verify router configuration specifically related to IPV6 SLAAC, Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) snooping.
2. Delete all the files of chip-tool /tmp folder. (`rm -rf /tmp/chip_*`)
3. After checking the router configuration, factory-reset your access point.

### 7. Commissioning failure at step 16

Verify the access point settings, SSID, PSK, secirity type, REGION, CHANNEL.

### 8 . Inconsistent logs

Verify external power is supplied to rs911x

### 9 . To enable different security options on AP/Router 

1. Get the router address by entering `route -n` or ifconfig of ipconfig.
2. Enter the router address in the browser and enter the appropriate username and password.
3. Select the appropriate band.
4. In security, select type (WPA / WPA2 / WPA3). 

### 10. CHIP Logs are not available on MG12 + WF200 due to image size constraints:

Due to apps taking up more space than available flash on the MG12 + WF200 device combination, `chip_logging=false` needs to be included on the command line while building the app image, 
to disable CHIP logs and thereby reduce the image size.

This prevents debugging the code on the MG12 + WF200 device combination.

In order to work around this constraint, disable either the LCD or the use of QR codes, depending on your debugging needs. Disabling one of these will sufficiently reduce the image size to allow 
CHIP Logging to be enabled. 

If you disabled QR Codes, you may use the `chip-tool` for commissioning the device.

If you disabled the LCD and need to debug with QR Codes, the URL to display the QR Code will be printed in the device logs.

Disable LCD and enable CHIP Logging:
`./scripts/examples/gn_silabs_example.sh examples/lock-app/silabs out/wf200_lock_app BRD4186C is_debug=false disable_lcd=true --wifi wf200 |& tee out/wf200_lock_app.log`

Disable QR Code and enable CHIP Logging:
`./scripts/examples/gn_silabs_example.sh examples/lock-app/silabs out/wf200_lock_app BRD4186C is_debug=false show_qr_code=false --wifi wf200 |& tee out/wf200_lock.log`

### 11. MG24 device sometimes loses its connection to Ozone during OTA Update with RS9116:

While performing an OTA Update with the EFR32MG24 + RS9116 device combination, when the device is reset and bootloading begins with the new image, the Ozone Debugger sometimes loses its connection.

There are two possible workarounds to this:

1. Immediately re-attach the device to the console when the connection is lost.

2. Download the RTT Viewer application instead and use it to view the logs during OTA Update.

### 12. MG24 device sometimes fails to bootload with the new image during OTA Update with WF200:

While performing an OTA Update with the EFR32MG24 + WF200 device combination using the external flash, when the device is reset and bootloading begins with the new image, the device sometimes starts up 
with the existing image instead of the newly downloaded one.

When this happens, perform the following steps to run the OTA Update successfully:

1. Disconnect the WF200 Expansion Board from the EFR32MG24.

2. Go To the Simplicity Commander's folder path in the command prompt and run the command below:
```shell
commander.exe extflash read --range 0x00:+<total size to read>
```

3. Reconnect the WF200 Expansion Board to the EFR32MG24 and reset the device.

4. Re-run the OTA Update process from the beginning.
