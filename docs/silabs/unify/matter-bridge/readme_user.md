# Unify Matter Bridge User Guide

The Unify Matter Bridge is a Unify IoT Service that enables interaction with
Unify devices from a Matter fabric. For a more thorough description see the
[Unify Matter Bridge Overview](./readme_overview.md).

As a prerequisite for the Matter Bridge to work, at least one Unify protocol
controller should be set up and running. This guide assumes that you have set up
the Z-Wave Protocol Controller (uic-zpc) to run on a Raspberry Pi 4 and
connected it to an MQTT broker in your network. Read the
[Unify Host SDK's Getting Started Guide](https://siliconlabs.github.io/UnifySDK/doc/getting_started.html)
for information on how to set this up.

Once a protocol controller is running, the Matter Bridge can be started.

The following documentation assumes that you have built the Unify Matter Bridge
application by following the _[Build Guide](./readme_building.md)_ and have
transferred the _`unify-matter-bridge`_ to your Raspberry Pi 4 (RPi4) running
the 64-bit version of Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye.

## Running the Matter Bridge

At start-up, the Matter Bridge needs to connect to the Matter Fabric as well as
the MQTT Broker. It is therefore critical that you have access to port 1883, the
default MQTT Broker's port, as well as a network setup that allows mDNS through.

A few important runtime configurations must be considered, along with some other
configuration options. A full list of command-line parameters is provided in the
[Command line arguments](#command-line-arguments) section.

### Important Configuration Settings

-   #### Network Interface

    Specify the network interface on which the Matter Fabric runs. In a regular
    RPi4 setup it would be `wlan0` for WiFi and `eth0` for ethernet. Specify
    this with the '`--umb.interface`' argument, as such:

    ```bash
    ./unify-matter-bridge --umb.interface eth0
    ```

-   #### Key-Value store (KVS)

    The Matter Bridge uses a Key-Value store for persisting various run-time
    configurations. Make sure to have read/write access to the default path
    '`/var/chip_unify_bridge.kvs`' or provide the path to where writing this
    data is allowed. If this file is deleted before start-up, everything is
    reset and the bridge will not belong to any Matter Fabric until it has again
    been commissioned.

    ```bash
    ./unify-matter-bridge --umb.kvs ./matter-bridge.kvs
    ```

-   #### MQTT Host

    If you have followed the
    [Unify Host SDK's Getting Started Guide](https://siliconlabs.github.io/UnifySDK/doc/getting_started.html),
    your MQTT Broker should now be running on '`localhost`'. If you have decided
    to run the MQTT broker on a different host, you can tell the Unify Matter
    Bridge to connect to a different host.

    ```bash
    ./unify-matter-bridge --mqtt.host 10.0.0.42
    ```

-   #### Vendor and Product ID

    If you have access to the EAP and you want to use the Google Home App, you
    need to set a specific VID and PID for the Matter Bridge.

    ```bash
    ./unify-matter-bridge --umb.vendor fff1 --umb.product 8001
    ```

### Starting the Matter Bridge

Once the configuration parameters are set it is time to start the bridge
application.

```bash
./unify-matter-bridge --umb.interface eth0 --umb.kvs ./matter-bridge.kvs --mqtt.host localhost --mqtt.port 1337
```

## Commissioning the Bridge to a Network

To include the bridge in the Matter network, it must first be commissioned. The
first time the bridge starts it will automatically go into commissioning mode.
After 10 minutes the bridge will exit commissioning mode. If the bridge has not
been commissioned within this window, the application must be restarted to open
the commissioning window again or the window can be opened by writing
`commission` in the CLI when running the bridge. The commission command may also
be used for multi-fabric commissioning.

The Unify Matter Bridge uses the "On Network" commissioning method. For now,
there is no Bluetooth commissioning support.

The commissioning procedure requires use of a pairing code. This pairing code is
written to the console when running the Matter Bridge. Look for something
similar to '`MT:-24J029Q00KA0648G00`', used as the pairing code in the following
example. This code can be used when commissioning with the CLI commissioning
tool `chip-tool`. 
```bash
[1659615301.367669][1967:1967] CHIP:SVR: SetupQRCode: [MT:-24J029Q00KA0648G00]
```

Additionally the pairing code will be published on the MQTT Broker on the topic
ucl/SmartStart/CommissionableDevice/MT:-24J029Q00KA0648G00. The Unify Developer
GUI has a page which display the QRCodes of all commissionable bridge which are
connected to the broker, ready to be scanned with a Google Home App or similar.

Another way to get the QR code is to look for an url in the console log similar
to and copy the link into a browser. Note that two codes a printed at startup
one for _Standard Commissioning flow_  and one for custom commissioning flow. 
Be sure to use the standard flow with Eco system devices. 

```bash
[1659615301.367723][1967:1967] CHIP:SVR: https://dhrishi.github.io/connectedhomeip/qrcode.html?data=MT%3A-24J029Q00KA0648G00
```

It should be noted that the commissioner **must** be on the same network as the
Raspberry Pi. Note that by default the bridge binds to the eth0 interface. If
another interface is to be used, see the description of the command line
arguments for setting [Network Interface](#network-interface).

### Using the chip-tool to Commission

In the following procedure make sure to use the pairing code taken from the
console output, as described above. To commission the Matter Bridge with the
`chip-tool` and assign the bridge the Node ID 1:

```bash
chip-tool pairing code 1 MT:-24J0AFN00KA0648G00
```


### Using Google Nest Hub

It is possible to use the Google Nest Hub (2nd. Gen) for controlling the Matter devices on the Unify Matter Bridge. Go through the following steps to configure this:

Prerequisites:
- Android Phone, Android 12 or newer
- Google Nest Hub, 2nd. Generation

Setup:
- Create a Google Account or using existing
- Go to [Google Developer Console](https://console.home.google.com/projects)
  - Click "Create a new project"
    - Next page click "Create project"
    - Input a unique project name 
  - Click "+ Add Matter integration"
    - Next: Develop
    - Next: Setup
    - Input following fields:
      - Product name of your choice
      - Device Type: Control Bridge
      - Test VID: default
      - Product ID (PID): 0x8001
    - Save & Continue
    - Save
- On your Android Phone
  - Configure the phone to use the same Google Account
  - Install Google Home application
  - To add the Nest Hub
    - Click "+" in the Google Home app - Add new device and let the phone search for your hub over BT - make sure hub is in reach
  - To add the Matter Bridge to your Google Home (and Hub)
    - In the console of the Matter Bridge application running on the Raspberry Pi
      - Hit `Return`, this should present `Unify>`
      - Type `commission`, this will show SetupQRCode, either click the link or in the Developer UI go to the "Commissionable Devices" page (note that a new QR code will be created whenever bridge is restarted, make sure to use the latest as identified in the output on the console)
    - In the Google Home app click "+"
      - Google Home should report "Matter-enabled device found"
      -   If the bridge is not automatically found, a list of device types will be shown, click the "Matter-device" on the list
      - Google Home will now ask for scanning the QR code - scan the QR code as described above
        - If Google Home is stuck during commissioning, type `commission` again in the Matter Bridge console while Google Home is waiting
  - All supported Unify devices should now be available for control in both Google Home application as well as the Google Nest Hub
    - On the Nest Hub, swipe down from the top of the display or select "Home Control" to access the devices

## Toggle an OnOff device

To send an OnOff cluster Toggle command to a bridged endpoint with id 2, via
Matter Fabric Node ID 1:

```bash
chip-tool onoff toggle 1 2
```

For more information on how to use the `chip-tool` see the
[chip-tool manual](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/matter/blob/latest/docs/guides/chip_tool_guide.md) on the Matter website.

## Toggle a Group of OnOff Devices

The Matter Bridge has support for forwarding group messages from the Matter
Fabric to Unify Nodes. The protocol controllers will send the group messages as
actual group cast messages on the destination network (Z-Wave/Zigbee).

To send a group command, first set up the group keys in the bridge. This example
assumes the bridge to be Node ID 1, and GroupKeySetID 42 is added to Group ID 1:

```bash
chip-tool accesscontrol write acl '[{"fabricIndex": 1, "privilege": 5, "authMode": 2, "subjects": [112233], "targets": null },{"fabricIndex": 1, "privilege": 4, "authMode": 3, "subjects": [1], "targets": null }]' 1 0
chip-tool groupkeymanagement key-set-write '{"groupKeySetID": 42, "groupKeySecurityPolicy": 0, "epochKey0": "d0d1d2d3d4d5d6d7d8d9dadbdcdddedf", "epochStartTime0": 2220000,"epochKey1": "d1d1d2d3d4d5d6d7d8d9dadbdcdddedf", "epochStartTime1": 2220001,"epochKey2": "d2d1d2d3d4d5d6d7d8d9dadbdcdddedf", "epochStartTime2": 2220002 }' 1 0
chip-tool groupkeymanagement write group-key-map '[{"groupId": 1, "groupKeySetID": 42, "fabricIndex": 1}]' 1 0
```

Next, add bridge endpoint 2 to Group ID 0x0001

```bash
chip-tool groups add-group 0x0001 grp1 1 2
```

Next, program the chip-tool:

```bash
chip-tool groupsettings add-group grp1 0x0002
chip-tool groupsettings add-keysets 0x0042 0 0x000000000021dfe0 hex:d0d1d2d3d4d5d6d7d8d9dadbdcdddedf
chip-tool groupsettings bind-keyset 0x0001 0x0042
```

Finally, a multicast command may be sent using the chip-tool.

```bash
// Send actual multicast command
./chip-tool onoff toggle 0xffffffffffff0001 1
```

## Running the matter bridge in strict device mapping mode 
By default Unify Matter Bridge tries and map devices that does not necessarily conform to the
Matter specification.

To enable a mode where Unify Matter Bridge strictly only maps devices from the Unify
Controller Language protocol to the Matter protocol that complies with the
Matter specification. You can run the bridge with the command line argument

```shell
./unify-matter-bridge --umb.strict_device_mapping true
```

## Command Line Arguments

The Unify Matter Bridge provides the following command line arguments:

Using --help displays the following text.

```shell
Usage: ./unify_matter_bridge [Options]

                                       application.
```
## Running chip-tool tests on Unify Matter Bridge endpoints 

For e.g. OnOff Cluster chip-tool test Test_TC_OO_2_3 can be ran on Unify Matter
Bridge endpoint 2 for node 1 as follows.

```bash
./chip-tool tests Test_TC_OO_2_3 --nodeId 1 --endpoint 2 --delayInMs 1400
```

Mapping of Matter Endpoint to Unify Node IDs can be seen by giving
"epmap" command to Unify matter bridge command prompt as follows

```shell
Unify>epmap
Unify Unid |Unify Endpoint |Matter Endpoint
zw-CE7F3772-0008|         |         2
```

Note: Endpoint 0(Root) and Endpoint 1(Aggregator) are Bridge itself. They are
not shown in the epmap. But these endpoints support some clusters as well. For
e.g. Identify. Where you might want to run chip-tool tests on those endpoints

For further information on chip-tool tests, refer to the [test suite's README](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/matter/blob/latest/src/app/tests/suites/README.md)

## Controlling a doorlock device using the chip-tool

To operate a DoorLock device that is mapped to a bridged endpoint with id 2
via Matter Fabric Node ID 1 using the chip-tool, perform the following operations.

### Reading an Attribute

```bash
chip-tool doorlock read <attribute name> 1 2
```

### Executing a Command

As Doorlock commands are timed interactions, we also need to provide a timeout value.

```bash
chip-tool doorlock lock-door 1 2 --timedInteractionTimeoutMs 5000
```

Note: For the DoorLock cluster, Commands need responses from the device. If the response is not received by chip-tool within the determined time, it will throw a TIMEOUT error.

### Reading and Subscribing to an Event

DoorLock support Events, which will be triggered based on the DoorState and LockOperations.

To read an event:

```bash
chip-tool doorlock read-event lock-operation 1 2 
```

To subscribe to an event, first we need to start an interactive session from chip-tool
and then use the below command.

```bash
chip-tool doorlock subscribe-event lock-operation <min-interval> <max-interval> 1 2
```

For more information on how to use the `chip-tool` see
[chip-tool manual](../../docs/guides/chip_tool_guide.md) on the Matter website.

## Troubleshooting

- Time sensitive chip-tool tests might fail because of the latencies in Unify Matter Bridge. The '` --delayInMs <number of milliseconds>`' command line option to chip-tool can be helpful in such cases.


- The Unify Matter Bridge needs to be commissioned to the Matter fabric before running the tests. Or you will see following message on the chip-tool tests

```shell
***** Test Step 0 : 1: Wait for the commissioned device to be retrieved
```

- To run all the tests without exiting on a failed one, '`--continueOnFailure true`'
can be used.


- Every cluster command sent by chip-tool can be seen on Unify Matter bridge as MQTT topic publish as follows

for .e.g if chip-tool sends OnOff On command on zw-CE7F3772-0008 Unify end node(Matter Endpoint 2). 
Then Unify Matter bridge publishes following MQTT payload and topic
 
```shell
2023-Jan-30 10:36:43.803360 <d> [command_translator_interface] --- send_unify_mqtt_cmd ucl/by-unid/zw-CE7F3772-0008/ep0/OnOff/Commands/On -> {} ---
```

The above MQTT debug message can also be traced in Unify logs.

- Every attribute read sent by chip-tool will only get correct value, if Unify Matter
Bridge publishes MQTT payload and topic like following, before chip-tool sends the attribute
read command.

For e.g. if chip-tool tries to read OnOff attribute of OnOff cluster on 
zw-CE7F3772-0008 Unify end node(Matter Endpoint 2) Unify Matter Bridge must 
have received following kind of MQTT message before the correct attribute value
will be reflected in Unify Matter Bridge.

```shell
2023-Jan-30 10:36:44.515748 <d> [mqtt_client] mqtt_client::on_message: ucl/by-unid/zw-CE7F3772-0008/ep0/OnOff/Attributes/OnOff/Reported, {"value":true}, 0
```

The above MQTT debug messages can also be traced in Unify logs.

- Alternatively to disable a particular command or disable reading particular
attributes from the test refer to PICS Usage from [README](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/matter/blob/latest/src/app/tests/suites/README.md)
