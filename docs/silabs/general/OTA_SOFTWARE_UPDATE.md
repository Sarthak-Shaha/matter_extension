# Matter Software Update with Silicon Labs Example Applications

This page outlines the steps for a scenario that demonstrates the Over
The Air (OTA) Software Update functionality of Matter.

Over The Air (OTA) Software Update functionality is enabled by default for
all Silicon Labs example applications.

## Hardware Requirements
- To run matter ota on Silicon Labs Platform, refer to: [Hardware Requirements](../general/HARDWARE_REQUIREMENTS.md)

## Software Requirements
- To run matter ota on Silicon Labs Platform, refer to: [Software Requirements](../general/SOFTWARE_REQUIREMENTS.md)

## Setting up OTA Environment

- **OTA-A**, the running image: a regular application built with the default/older software version value. This application will be updated to the one with a higher software version. In the OTA Software Update process it acts as the OTA Requestor.
- **OTA-B**, the update image: a regular application built with a higher software version value.
- **Chip-tool**: the controller that announces the OTA-Provider's address to the application thus triggering the OTA Software Update.
- **OTA-Provider**: the server that carries the update image and from which the OTA Requestor will download the updated software.
- **Bootloader**: Silicon Labs Gecko Bootloader image that supports OTA; supports the external (SPI-flash) or the internal storage option.


### Setting up Chip-tool 

The chip-tool binary is a part of the Silicon Labs' Matter Hub Raspberry Pi Image available as a part of the Release Artifacts page. If you are planning to run chip-tool on the Matter Hub you may skip the rest of this section.

If you have not downloaded or cloned this repository, you can run the following 
commands on a Linux terminal running on either Linux machine, WSL or Virtual
Machine to clone the repository and run bootstrap to prepare to build the sample
application images.

1. To download the [SiliconLabs Matter codebase](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/matter.git), run the following commands.

    ```shell
     $ git clone https://github.com/SiliconLabs/matter.git
    ```

2. Bootstrapping:

    ```shell
    $ cd matter
    $ ./scripts/checkout_submodules.py --shallow --recursive --platform efr32
    $ . scripts/bootstrap.sh
    # Create a directory where binaries will be updated/compiled called `out`
    $ mkdir out
    ```

    To control the  Matter application you will have to compile and run the chip-tool on either a Linux, Mac, or Raspberry Pi. The chip-tool builds faster on the Mac and Linux machines so that is recommended, but if you have access to a Raspberry Pi that will work as well.


3. Build the chip-tool

    ```shell
    $ ./scripts/examples/gn_build_example.sh examples/chip-tool out/standalone
    ```

This will build chip-tool in `out/standalone`.


### Setting up OTA-Provider

The chip-ota-provider-app binary for a Raspberry Pi is a part of the Artifacts package available with the Matter Extension release. If you are planning to run the OTA-Provider on a Raspberry Pi there is no need to build it. 

- To Build OTA-Provider app for Linux Platform, run below command in the matter repository.

```shell
scripts/examples/gn_build_example.sh examples/ota-provider-app/linux out/debug chip_config_network_layer_ble=false
```

## Matter OTA Application Images
- To create and Build matter OTA from matter code, need two different applications to build mentioned below:
  - OTA A
  - OTA B

### Build OTA A Application
 - Matter OTA-A Application will be used to flash on the matter device.
 - In matter cloned directory run below commands to build an OTA A application.

    For RS9116:
    ``` 
    ./scripts/examples/gn_silabs_example.sh examples/lighting-app/silabs/ out/rs911x_lighting_A BRD41xxx disable_lcd=true use_external_flash=false chip_enable_ble_rs911x=true --wifi rs9116
    ``` 

    For WF200:
    ``` 
    ./scripts/examples/gn_silabs_example.sh examples/lighting-app/silabs/ out/wf200_lighting_A BRD41xxx chip_build_libshell=false --wifi wf200
    ``` 

    For SiWx917 NCP:
    ``` 
    ./scripts/examples/gn_silabs_example.sh examples/lighting-app/silabs/ out/siwx917_lighting BRD41xxx disable_lcd=true use_external_flash=false --wifi SiWx917
    ``` 

    For SiWx917 SOC:
    ``` 
    ./scripts/examples/gn_silabs_example.sh examples/lighting-app/silabs/ out/SiWx917_lighting BRD4388A
    ```

**Note:** Matter OTA-A application will be having software version as 1 by default in **third_party/silabs/BUILD.gn** file.

### Build OTA B Application
- Matter OTA-B application will be used to create gbl & OTA file.
- Open the file **third_party/silabs/BUILD.gn** from matter code cloned directory and modify **sl_matter_version = 1** to any number.

**Note:** Make sure always **sl_matter_version** should be greater than **sl_hardware_version**
- After Modifying software version build OTA B application using below commands:

```
For RS9116: 

./scripts/examples/gn_silabs_example.sh examples/lighting-app/silabs/ out/rs911x_lighting_B BRD41xxx use_external_flash=false chip_enable_ble_rs911x=true --wifi rs9116

For WF200

./scripts/examples/gn_silabs_example.sh examples/lighting-app/silabs/ out/wf200_lighting_B BRD41xxx chip_build_libshell=false --wifi wf200

For SiWx917 NCP

./scripts/examples/gn_silabs_example.sh examples/lighting-app/silabs/ out/siwx917_lighting BRD41xxx disable_lcd=true use_external_flash=false --wifi SiWx917

For SiWx917 SOC

./scripts/examples/gn_silabs_example.sh examples/lighting-app/silabs/ out/SiWx917_lighting BRD4388A

```

## Running the OTA Download Scenario

- Image will be created and uploaded onto Raspberry Pi which provides the firmware image chunk by chunk to the device.
- Host will initiate the OTA download and provider app will start the OTA image transfer.
- Host will receive combined image and host will transfer the firmware image on to the flash backup location chunk by chunk.
- Once image is downloaded, the device will reboot into the downloaded image.

### Creation of GBL and OTA Images

#### For EFR NCP Devices

- Create a bootable image file (using the Lighting application image as an
    example):


   ```shell
    commander gbl create chip-efr32-lighting-example.gbl --compress lzma --app chip-efr32-lighting-example.s37
    ```
**Note**:- Using LZMA compression when building the .gbl file ( passing `--compress lzma` parameter to the `commander gbl create` command) further reduces the downloaded image size.

- Create the Matter OTA file from the bootable image file:

    ```shell
    $ commander ota create --type matter --input chip-efr32-lighting-example.gbl --vendorid 0xFFF1 --productid 0x8005 --swstring "2.0" --swversion 2 --digest sha256 -o chip-efr32-lighting-example.ota
    ```
#### For SiWx917 SoC Devices

Storing a single Matter combined upgrade image(TA+M4) and transfer the image to the co-processor and rewrite the 917 firmware as well as M4 firmware Image then boot loading with the upgraded TA processor image and the M4 processor image.

Host will initiate OTA download to receive combined image (TA+M4) and store M4 and TA image on flash backup location.

##### Use Cases

- Combined image where TA and M4 images to be upgraded. M4 image also has the **sl_matter_version** modified with the latest version.
- Only M4 image to be upgraded. M4 image also has the **sl_matter_version** modified with the latest version.
- Only TA image to be upgraded. In this case, We need to have a M4 image with just **sl_matter_version** modified with the latest version. This would be similar to Combined image upgrade.

##### Creation of OTA Images

- The first step is to create a combined image that contains both the firmwares (TA & M4).
- This image is created by combining the binary images of both firmwares.
- For the Matter OTA file, create a bootable image file with the .rps format (using the Lighting application image as an example) and then create the Matter OTA file from the bootable image file using commands provided below.
- Once the .ota file is created, it will be uploaded onto the Raspberry Pi where the OTA provider application is running.

###### Generating The Combined OTA image

- Create TA  image (.rps) with combined image flag set by using command.

    ```shell
    commander rps convert <ta_image_combined.rps> --taapp <ta_image.rps> --combinedimage
    ```

- Create M4 .rps file from .s37 using below command.

    ```shell
    commander rps create <m4_image.rps> --app <m4_image.s37>
    ```

- Create M4 (.rps) with combined image flag set by using command.

    ```shell
    commander rps convert <m4_image_combined.rps> --app <m4_image.rps> --combinedimage
    ```

- Create combined image from the above created TA and M4 images.

    ```shell
    commander rps convert "combined_image.rps" --app "m4_image_combined.rps" --taapp "ta_image_combined.rps" 
    ```

- Create the Matter OTA file from the bootable image file.

    ```shell
    ./src/app/ota_image_tool.py create -v 0xFFF1 -p 0x8005 -vn 2 -vs "2.0" -da sha256 combined_image.rps combined_image.ota
    ```
**Note:** For TA(alone) OTA firmware upgrade, follow the same steps as above.

###### Generating The M4 OTA image

- Create M4 (.s37) image to  (.rps) image using below command.

    ```shell
    commander rps create <m4_image.rps> --app <m4_image.s37>
    ```

- Create the Matter OTA file from the bootable image file

    ```shell
    ./src/app/ota_image_tool.py create -v 0xFFF1 -p 0x8005 -vn 2 -vs "2.0" -da sha256 m4_image.rps m4_image.ota
    ```

### Running OTA Provider

- Locate **ota-provider** terminal and start the Provider app passing to it the path to the Matter OTA file created in the previous step:

- In a terminal start the Provider app and pass to it the path to the Matter
    OTA file created in the previous step:

    ```shell
    $ rm -r /tmp/chip_kvs_provider
    ```

    ```shell
    ./out/chip-ota-provider-app  --KVS /tmp/chip_kvs_provider -f chip-efr32-lighting-example.ota
    ```

### Setting up OTA-Requestor

- Before running **ota-requestor** app flash the bootloader binary images for Silicon Labs Devices.

#### Flash Bootloader Images

- Bootloader binaries will be flashed using Simplicity Commander only. It will support EFR32 NCP Boards only.
- Silicon Labs Devices will supports below Bootloader variants for EFR32 Boards.
    - Internal Storage Bootloader
    - External Storage Bootloader
- To Flash the Bootloader Binary along with the application for Silicon Labs Device, refer [Flashing Binaries](../general/FLASHING_USING_COMMANDER.md)

### Running OTA-Requestor

- In a separate terminal run the chip-tool commands to provision the Provider:

    ```shell
    $ ./out/chip-tool pairing onnetwork 1 20202021
    ```

    ```shell
    $ ./out/chip-tool accesscontrol write acl '[{"fabricIndex": 1, "privilege": 5, "authMode": 2, "subjects": [112233], "targets": null}, {"fabricIndex": 1, "privilege": 3, "authMode": 2, "subjects": null, "targets": null}]' 1 0
    ```
- For Matter over OpenThread, bring up the OpenThread Border Router and get its operational
    dataset, for Matter over WiFi bring up the AP. 
    
- If the application device had been previously commissioned, hold Button 0
    for six seconds to factory-reset the device.

- Commission the device. 
  For Matter over OpenThread:
   
    ```shell
    $ ./out/chip-tool pairing ble-thread 2 hex:<operationalDataset> 20202021 3840
    ```
    where operationalDataset is obtained from the OpenThread Border Router.

    For Matter over WiFi:
    ```shell
      ./out/chip-tool pairing ble-wifi "node_id" "SSID" "PSK" 20202021 3840
    ```

- Once the commissioning process completes enter:

    ```shell
    $ ./out/chip-tool otasoftwareupdaterequestor announce-otaprovider 1 0 0 0 2 0
    ```
- The application device will connect to the Provider and start the image download. Once the image is downloaded the device will reboot into the downloaded image.

## Multi-Chip OTA Images
Multi-Chip OTA is implemented only for EFR32 devices. Multi-chip OTA uses an enhanced ota_image_tool.py script which creates .ota files that contain additional TLV headers. These TLV headers describe the binaries to be sent over the air. The enhanced script is located at scripts/tool/silabs/ota/ota_image_tool.py which is a wrapper to the original src/app/ota_image_tool.py. Multiple binaries can be packaged in the .ota file. Some Tags are reserved for specific Silicon Labs binaries, and other Tags are available to be used for arbitrary TLVs. The payloads can be encrypted. 

For more information on creating a Multi-Chip .ota file see the 
[README.md](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/matter/blob/latest/scripts/tools/silabs/ota/README.md)

OTA-A applications must be built with an additional gn argument to enable them to process the TLVs. 

    ```shell
    $ ./scripts/examples/gn_silabs_example.sh examples/lighting-app/silabs/ out/lighting-app BRD41xx chip_enable_multi_ota_requestor=true
    ```

chip_enable_multi_ota_encryption=true should be added to the build command if the requestor is meant to process encrypted payloads.
