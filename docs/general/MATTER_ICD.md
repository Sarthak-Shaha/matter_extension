# Matter Intermittently Connected Devices (ICD)

Matter introduces the concept of Intermittently Connected Devices (ICD) in the SDK and in the specification.
An Intermittently Connected Device is the Matter representation of a device that is not always reachable.
This covers battery-powered devices that disable their underlying hardware when in a low-power mode or devices that can be disconnected from the network, like a phone app.

This page focuses on features designed to improve the performance and reliability of battery-powered devices. By default Matter ICD functionality is enabled.

## ICD Device Types

Matter introduces two types of ICDs.

- Short Idle Time ICDs
- Long Idle Time ICDs

### Short Idle Time ICDs

Short Idle Time ICDs are battery powered devices that can always be reached by clients.
This means that their polling intervals are small enough to guarantee that a message sent from a client will be able to reach the ICD without any synchronization.
A door lock, for example, is typicaly a short idle time ICD because it needs to be able to receive commands from clients at any given time.
These devices are usually not the initiators in the communication flow.

### Long Idle ICDs

Long Idle Time ICDs are battery powered devices that require synchronization between the client and the ICD for communication to succeed.
A sensor device is an example of a device that are typicaly long idle time ICDs.

Long Idle Time ICDs are provisional with the Matter 1.3 alpha release.


## ICD Management Cluster

The ICD Management Cluster enables configuration of the ICD’s behavior.
It is required for an ICD to have this cluster enabled on endpoint 0.

The ICDM Cluster exposes three configuration attributes that enable to configure an ICD.

| Attribute | Type | Constraints | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| IdleModeInterval      | uint32 | 1 to 64800 | Maximum interval in seconds or milliseconds the server can stay in idle mode |
| ActiveModeInterval    | uint32 | min 300    | minimum interval in milliseconds the server will stay in active mode |
| ActiveModeThreshold   | uint32 | min 300    | minimum amount of time in milliseconds the server typically will stay active after network activity when in active mode |

These configurations can be change two different ways.

They can be changed by using the following build configuration.
```cpp
    sl_idle_mode_interval_ms = 600000  //10min Idle Mode Interval
    sl_active_mode_interval_ms = 1000  //1s Active Mode Interval
    sl_active_mode_threshold_ms = 500  //500ms Active Mode Threshold
```   
To change them within a build command
```shell
./scripts/examples/gn_silabs_example.sh ./examples/light-switch-app/silabs ./out/light-switch-app_ICD BRD4187C --icd sl_idle_mode_interval_ms=600000 sl_active_mode_interval_ms=1000 sl_active_mode_threshold_ms= 500
```
These options can also be change by setting them to a default value in the projects openthread.gni file. See examples/lock-app/silabs/openthread.gni for an example on how they can be configured.
```cpp
// ICD Matter Configuration flags
sl_idle_mode_interval_s = 600       //10min Idle Mode Interval
sl_active_mode_interval_ms = 10000  //10s Active Mode Interval
sl_active_mode_threshold_ms = 1000  //1s Active Mode Threshold
```
The second way of changing the configuration is to set these defines in the projects ChipProjectConfig.h.

```cpp
/**
 * @def CHIP_CONFIG_ICD_IDLE_MODE_INTERVAL_SEC
 *
 * @brief Default value for the ICD Management cluster IdleModeInterval attribute, in seconds
 */
#define CHIP_CONFIG_ICD_IDLE_MODE_INTERVAL_SEC 2


/**
 * @def CHIP_CONFIG_ICD_ACTIVE_MODE_INTERVAL_MS
 *
 * @brief Default value for the ICD Management cluster ActiveModeInterval attribute, in milliseconds
 */
#define CHIP_CONFIG_ICD_ACTIVE_MODE_INTERVAL_MS 300

/**
 * @def CHIP_CONFIG_ICD_ACTIVE_MODE_THRESHOLD_MS
 *
 * @brief Default value for the ICD Management cluster ActiveModeThreshold attribute, in milliseconds
 */
#define CHIP_CONFIG_ICD_ACTIVE_MODE_THRESHOLD_MS 300
```
Using the build arguments either in the build command or in the openthread.gni file is the preferred method.


## Subscription Maximum Interval

The subscription mechanism is used by ecosystems and controllers to receive attribute change updates and liveness checks.
The maximum interval of a subscription request is what defines the frequency at which a device will send a liveness check if there are no attribute changes.

Within the subscription request / response model, a device has the opportunity to decide the maximum interval at which it will send its liveness check (Empty Report Update). The device can set a maximum interval within this range if and only if it is an ICD:

```shell
MinIntervalRequested ≤ MaxInterval ≤ MAX(IdleModeInterval, MaxIntervalRequested)
```

The following table shows the subscribe response fields.
| Action Field | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| SubscriptionId | uint32 | identifies the subscription |
| MaxInterval | uint16 | the final maximum interval for the subscription in seconds |

### Maximum Interval Negotiation

The Matter SDK provides a default implementation that allows an ICD to negotiate its MaxInterval.
The goal of the algorithm is to set the MaxInterval to the IdleModeInterval.

```cpp
#if CHIP_CONFIG_ENABLE_ICD_SERVER

    // Default behavior for ICDs where the wanted MaxInterval for a subscription is the IdleModeInterval
    // defined in the ICD Management Cluster.
    // Behavior can be changed with the OnSubscriptionRequested function defined in the application callbacks

    // Default Behavior Steps :
    // If MinInterval > IdleModeInterval, try to set the MaxInterval to the first interval of IdleModeIntervals above the
    // MinInterval.
    // If the next interval is greater than the MaxIntervalCeiling, use the MaxIntervalCeiling.
    // Otherwise, use IdleModeInterval as MaxInterval

    // GetPublisherSelectedIntervalLimit() returns the IdleModeInterval if the device is an ICD
    uint32_t decidedMaxInterval = GetPublisherSelectedIntervalLimit();

    // Check if the PublisherSelectedIntervalLimit is 0. If so, set decidedMaxInterval to MaxIntervalCeiling
    if (decidedMaxInterval == 0)
    {
        decidedMaxInterval = mMaxInterval;
    }

    // If requestedMinInterval is greater than the IdleTimeInterval, select next active up time as max interval
    if (mMinIntervalFloorSeconds > decidedMaxInterval)
    {
        uint16_t ratio = mMinIntervalFloorSeconds / static_cast<uint16_t>(decidedMaxInterval);
        if (mMinIntervalFloorSeconds % decidedMaxInterval)
        {
            ratio++;
        }

        decidedMaxInterval *= ratio;
    }

    // Verify that decidedMaxInterval is an acceptable value (overflow)
    if (decidedMaxInterval > System::Clock::Seconds16::max().count())
    {
        decidedMaxInterval = System::Clock::Seconds16::max().count();
    }

    // Verify that the decidedMaxInterval respects MAX(GetPublisherSelectedIntervalLimit(), MaxIntervalCeiling)
    uint16_t maximumMaxInterval = std::max(GetPublisherSelectedIntervalLimit(), mMaxInterval);
    if (decidedMaxInterval > maximumMaxInterval)
    {
        decidedMaxInterval = maximumMaxInterval;
    }

    // Set max interval of the subscription
    mMaxInterval = static_cast<uint16_t>(decidedMaxInterval);

#endif // CHIP_CONFIG_ENABLE_ICD_SERVER
```

If the default implementation does fit within the use-case,
an implementation can override the default implementation.
The first step is to implement the `ApplicationCallback` class from the `ReadHandler.h` header.

```cpp
/*
 * A callback used to interact with the application.
 */
class ApplicationCallback
{
public:
    virtual ~ApplicationCallback() = default;
    /*
     * Called right after a SubscribeRequest has been parsed and processed. This notifies an interested application
     * of a subscription that is about to be established. It also provides an avenue for altering the parameters of the
     * subscription (specifically, the min/max negotiated intervals) or even outright rejecting the subscription for
     * application-specific reasons.
     *
     * TODO: Need a new IM status code to convey application-rejected subscribes. Currently, a Failure IM status code is sent
     * back to the subscriber, which isn't sufficient.
     *
     * To reject the subscription, a CHIP_ERROR code that is not equivalent to CHIP_NO_ERROR should be returned.
     *
     * More information about the set of paths associated with this subscription can be retrieved by calling the appropriate
     * Get* methods below.
     *
     * aReadHandler:            Reference to the ReadHandler associated with the subscription.
     * aSecureSession:          A reference to the underlying secure session associated with the subscription.
     *
     */
    virtual CHIP_ERROR OnSubscriptionRequested(ReadHandler & aReadHandler, Transport::SecureSession & aSecureSession)
    {
        return CHIP_NO_ERROR;
    }
    /*
     * Called after a subscription has been fully established.
     */
    virtual void OnSubscriptionEstablished(ReadHandler & aReadHandler){};
    /*
     * Called right before a subscription is about to get terminated. This is only called on subscriptions that were terminated
     * after they had been fully established (and therefore had called OnSubscriptionEstablished).
     * OnSubscriptionEstablishment().
     */
    virtual void OnSubscriptionTerminated(ReadHandler & aReadHandler){};
 };
```

The second step is registering the callback object to the Interaction Model Engine.

```cpp
// Register ICD subscription callback to match subscription max intervals to its idle time interval
chip::app::InteractionModelEngine::GetInstance()->RegisterReadHandlerAppCallback(&mICDSubscriptionHandler);
```

## Persistent Subscriptions

Persistent subscriptions were added to Matter as a means to ensure that an ICD can re-establish its subscription and by extension its secure session to a subscriber in the event of a power cycle.
When a device accepts a subscription request, it will persist the subscription.
When the device reboots, it will try to re-establish its subscription with the subscriber.
If the subscription is torn down during normal operations or if the re-establishment fails,
the subscription will be deleted.

Persistent subscriptions are enabled by default on all Silicon Labs sample applications.

### Subscription Timeout Resumption

Matter also provides a retry mechanism for devices to try to re-establish a lost subscription with a client. This feature should not be used on an ICD since it can significantly reduce battery life. This functionality can be disabled by adding

`chip_subscription_timeout_resumption = false`

## Subscription Synchronization

To avoid forcing an ICD to become active multiple times, the Matter SDK allows an ICD to synchronize its subscription reporting and send all the reports at the same time. The mecansim syncrhonizes the maximum interval of the all subscription to only require the ICD to become active one. This functionality can be enabled by adding

`sl_use_subscription_synching = true`
